**Today's Progress**: Spent today going through additional lessons on the CSS course on Solo Learn. I am about half way through this course.

**Thoughts**: None today, just pushing through...

### Day 48: March 13. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Back from vacation and back to it! Spent today getting back up to speed and in the groove by going through additional lessons on the CSS course on Solo Learn.

**Thoughts**: Even though I am learning all of this, I am wondering how I will apply it and retain it if I am not working in the field day in and day out...

### March 4th through March 12th. OFF due to being on vacation.

### Day 47: March 3. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the Solo Learn HTML course and received my certificte! I even started the CSS course and should be done with that soon. I went through the Project #2 - Calculator solution for the JavaScript from Scratch course on Udemy.

**Thoughts**: I really think I need to edit and customize already established and written JavaScript code to better understand it. It is how I learned HTML and CSS. Customizing pieces of code that fit to what I needed it to do. Maybe that is the answer to understand JavaScript. I am taking a break as we are going on vacation to Disney World.

### Day 46: March 2. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I went through additional The Complete Course: 2018 JavaScript Essentials From Scratch lessons, mainly focused on Functions and Events. I will be starting the Calculator project (#2) tomorrow. I signed up for Solo Learn and started the HTML course. Going through these pretty quickly.

**Thoughts**: I think I get JavaScript and then in the same breath I don't think I'll ever understand JavaScript.

### Day 45: March 1. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I went through additional The Complete Course: 2018 JavaScript Essentials From Scratch lessons, mainly about Query Selectors. I created my own sample page and js as well. I also read a great article today about CSS artwork. It got me really really excited to delve into that after these other courses are completed. Looks like fun!

**Thoughts**: Don't give up. That is the mantra I hear over and over again from people learning and those that support new coders or coders in general. So, I am not giving up!

### Day 44: February 28. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Spent today showing how Chris can use Wix for our band website. Not much coding going on there, but still a lot of elements to consider and navigating through questions and solutions.

**Thoughts**: I have heard that coding jobs inolve so much more than just coding. Today wa a good example, I believe, of the different things you have to juggle and understand to be a well rounded front-end developer.

**Links to work**: [Tweet link](https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/969034234190065664)

### OFF DAY: February 27. Tuesday

**Reason**: Jammed Day with work and then out the dor for rehearsal after a quick bite for dinner. Home late at midnight.

### Day 43: February 26. Monday

**Today's Progress**: I continued with the JavaScript from Scratch course and learned about operators and if/else statements. I got my console up and working in my Atom IDE so I don't have to keep switching between browser and editor.


**Thoughts**: I'm not sure if Ill ever take coding into a job situation or career, but I am having fun learning these languages. Today marks the start of Week Seven in this awesome coding challenge!

### Day 42: February 25. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I started and completed Project 1 from the JavaScript Course. This was a project where you needed to end up making a URL friendly address using strings and methods. I worked on it in the console and Atom until it worked. Then I watched the solution on how Kalob would have done it. He added a step I didn't add and I added additional steps he hadn't added, but in the end they were both correct. It feels really good when you work it out on your own!

**Thoughts**: Many times your cose or project will not end up being an exact replica of the person teaching or your colleague. It will have your own take, but you can always learn from how they approached it and apply it to your knowledge base.

**Links to work**: [Tweet link](https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/967933793716854784)

### Day 41: February 24. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I continued the JavaScript from Scratch course. Played around in the console for a long time to see how things work. Tomorrow I start on Project 1 of 3 for this course

**Thoughts**: Just spending a little bit of time coding is really helpful and re-connects the things that I have been learning.

**Links to work**: [Tweet link](https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/967598150482526210)

### Day 40: February 23. Friday

**Today's Progress**: I feel like I really need to learn more JavaScript before I go back to the Front End Developers Certificate on freeCodeCamp. So, I started Kalob Tauliens fullblown JS course for free since he provided a free link after I finished the 'mini-course'. The Complete Course: 2018 JavaScript Essentials From Scratch is what it is called.

**Thoughts**: Not much in-depth today. I do like it when I find the zone and end up coding or learning for hours.

### DAY OFF: February 22. Thursday

**PERSONAL DAY**

### Day 39: February 21. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Well, today I got a lot settled! I realized I needed to separate my form area in a new div. Created the CSS and html for that. 3 column form with all labels/inputs centered. Found an easy to use HTML to email php code I could use on the form. I created Thank you and Error pages for the php form functions to work properly. Test and everything is working as intended! The only concern now is media size on Chrome browser. I am getting overflow pushing the form into everything. I tested on Firefox and everything seems to minimize properly. I need to look into further.

**Thought**: I was really doubting whether or not I had the umph to continue down this road, but every time I ever seem to have any doubts, I get a kick in the pants and seem to pick up steam. I must have spent 4 hours or more cosing today. Really applying things I have learned and finding my own way to code and complete the tasks. Feels good! I do need to get httpS for my site.

### Day 38: February 20. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I worked and worked at trying to get forms down and in place on my footer last night. This is where all the other contact info to social liks is, so I wanted to work it into that area. Frustrating. I worked with forms and CSS and tried so many variations to see what would break and how it would be affected by changing this or that. I was even looking at other people's CSS Grid forms and considered using them. Shame.

**Thoughts**: I'll have to try again fresh tomorrow and see if I can find a way to make forms and grid work properly with how I have my site currently laid out.

### Day 37: February 19. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed: 'The Ultimate HTML Developer' course by Kalob Taulien passed with flying colors, but never received any certificate? Maybe it is sent via email? I left a comment on the discussion area on ArkMont. 

**Thoughts**: Not sure where to go next. I was thinking back to freeCodeCamp Dev Certification course, but I feel like I need some more hands on work and practice. Then I would like more practice on JavaScript.

**Links to work**: [Tweet link](https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/965770848073338881)

### Day 36: February 18. Sunday

**Tody's Progress**: Almost thru Module 2: 'The Ultimate HTML Developer' course by Kalob Taulien but went down the rabbit hole on Forms & how they work with CSS Grid layout. Worked on forms for 2 hrs+. I applied a bunch of different scenarios to my Portfolio page, but have not found the right one. I think tomorrow I'll sit down and come up with my own code.

**Thoughts**: I can't wait to put myself out there to see what I can come up with and where I can help. I think I want to reach out to charity or social work orgs that may need any type of help with front end dev or marketing, etc...

**Links to work**: [Tweet link](https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/965411278410993665)

### Day 35: February 17. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Halfway thru Module 2: 'The Ultimate HTML Developer' course by Kalob Taulien, hoping to finish that off tomorrow. Listened to my first Learn To Code With Me podcast E1S1, very good interview and discussion!

**Thoughts**: The poscast had a lot of interesting similarities with me. I basically trained myself html and CSS and got into eCommerce sites and Payment, Shipping and marketing areas...then felt like I didn't deserve or live up to being considered a 'programmer' or 'coder' so I moved back into familiar grounds like customer service and sales. There is no cert or badge you get which states "YOU ARE NOW A PROGRAMMER"...so build, code, test, try, put yourself out there and see what comes of it!!!

**Links to work**: [Tweet link](https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/965061828761055232)

### Day 34: February 16. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Module 1: 'The Ultimate HTML Developer' course by Kalob Taulien Nice to go over current standards & uses after a long coding layoff.

**Thoughts**: You never know what you may miss when you've taken a course on a particular subject before. Plus, as you mature you can understand thisngs completely from a different viewpoint.

**Links to work**: [Tweet link](https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/964646433658953728)

### Day 33: February 15. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Wes Bos CSS Grid Masters Course. This was a really good course and the teaching was excellent. I applied many tips to my portfolio site and now my nav flows properly. I was just using hard column numbers instead of incorporating 'span' into the length of nav item.   

**Thoughts**: Going to tackle the Arkmont course: "The Ultimate HTML Developer - Learn proper HTML from scratch." Feels good to resolidify the basics after being away from coding for so long.

### Day 32: February 14. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Went thru additional parts in the Wes Bos CSS Grid Masters course and applied some of the techniques he showed to my own site to play around with concepts. Looking to finish this tutorial Thursday.  

**Thoughts**: Wes Bos makes programming look like just conversation when watching his videos. It is like he has this "fluent programming" language that has a really nice accent!

### Day 31: February 13. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Went through additional parts in the Wes Bos CSS Grid Masters course. 

**Thoughts**: Really loving CSS Grid and I seem to keep coming back to it. I used to be so frustrated by floats and z-index and negative margins, absolutes..., so may other layout issues with CSS. I actually find CSS Grid layout FUN!

### Day 30: February 12. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started the CSS Grid course by Wes Bos. Checked out some podcasts on the freeCodeCamp site. Some were okay, different views on coding and learning.

**Thoughts**: I really enjoy hopping back and forth between different subjects - i.e. HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Hopefully it won't lead to confusion the deeper I get, but so far so good. They seem to work well together and also just stripped down on their own.

### Day 29: February 11. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the JavaScript Essentials 2018 Mini Course on Udemy and signed up for two other free courses. One being a Full Stack Web Developer Course and the other a free Ultimate HTML Developer Course. Got through another few challenges on the freeCodeCamp Front End Development Certification course.

**Thoughts**: I realized I have been writing this daily log backwards. I should be updating at the top. I'll re-arrange one of these days but today was the day to start, lol.

**Today's Progress**: Today I went through Lessons 13-37 on the #freeCodeCamp front end certification challenge

**Thoughts:** Let's code! It feels really good to remember a lot of what I used to do on a regular basis!

**Link to work:** Tweet link https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/952290151279091712

### Day 2: January 14. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished 'HTML5 and CSS' #refresher in the Front End Development Certification course!

**Thoughts**: CCS and HTML have not changed much since the last time I was programming a few years back. Coming back to me...

**Link to work**: Tweet link https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/952585101103239173

### Day 3: January 15. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started the 'Responsive Design with Bootstrap' in the Front End Development Certification course! Over halfway through that...tomorrow finish the segment starting at 'Create a Bootstrap Headline'

**Thoughts**: Worked with Bootstrap in later Wordpress templates and it kind of intimidated me back then. Now, not so much as I am learning the ins and outs of it. I did work with FontAwesome on previous sites, but the syntax in the courses have expanded that use for sure.

**Link to work**: Tweet link https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/953100248884359174

### Day 4: January 16. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 'Responsive Design with Bootstrap' in the Front End Development Certification course! Started the jQuery course

**Thoughts**: Stay the course

**Link to work**: Tweet link https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/953401646809219072

### Day 5: January 17. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Set up GitHub, watched tutorials and read articles related to the use of GitHub. Installed on my Linux and working with CLI to clone reps, update files, get status, add files, learn to comment my commits ( -m ) 
Set up my daily log for my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Completed the 'jQuery' in the Front End Development Certification course!

**Thoughts**: Gotta crawl before you walk

**Link to work**: I used the following to learn more about GitHub:

Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/953764679834324992

### Day 6: January 18. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started the 'Tribute Page' project on the 'Front End Development Certification' course. Committed to only using Bootstrap. I am using getbootstrap.com resources like crazy just learning all the rules and syntax.

**Thoughts**: I need to see what other sites are available for Bootstrap tips and tricks. Currently learning version 4.

### Day 7: January 19. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed my 'Tribute Page' project on the 'Front End Development Certification' course. My tribute was to the late great Lemmy Kilmister 

**Thoughts**: Noticed some bootstrap elements are not 'all-browser' compliant...ugg. Looks differently in Firefox than Chrome, for example.

Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/954447265808216065

### Day 8: January 20. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Uploaded my Tribute Page code/file to GitHub repo. Reviewed the next project requirements for the Portfolio' project and started with initial design layout ideas. Started reading 'Practical Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python 3.6' as I want to sign up for the Coursera UofT's 'Learn to Program: The Fundamentals' course.

**Thoughts**: Don't take on too much too soon and get burnt out! Don't a breath and approach each day as its own, not worrying about what you still need to accomplish!

Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/954868540326150144

### Day 9: January 21. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished 1st part of 'Learn CSS Grid' on Scrimba as I want to incorporate this into my portfolio project instead of bootstrap. It's compliant across all browsers and appears to be less code and fuss.

**Thoughts**: So many ways you can use new libraries and techniques to create layouts for front end development!

Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/955153254165504000

### Day 10: January 22. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Not much today. I learned more about using CSS Grid fixed positions so I can incorporate it into my portfilio project. I need the navigation to stay fixed on the screen while scrolling. This means this 'container' needs to be in it's own grid or else you'll break the rest of the grid where content and footer would be. I also updated the Wordpress version on company site and registered additional domains.

**Thoughts**: Goal is to have Portfolio Project completed by end of week, using as much CSS Grid as possible.

Fixed position using CSS Grid: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43999732/how-to-make-a-fixed-column-in-css-using-css-grid-layout

### Day 11: January 23. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Studied, read, practiced more CSS Grid articles, documentation, examples and blogs. Started practicing on the Portfolio Project. Installed 'Brackets' IDE.

**Thoughts**: I'd really like to maybe specialize or focus on CSS Design and Coding

### Day 12: January 24. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Didn't feel like much progress was made. In fact, I felt like an idiot throughout the day trying to code my Portfolio Project. I have been trying to use CSS Grid and HTML, no other libraries or tools. I just hit a brick wall. I ended up reading about 4 hours of documentation related to CSS, HTML, Grid, Flex, you name it!

**Thoughts**: There is SOOOOOOO much to learn and apply yet.

**Link to work**: Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/956366303849340929

### Day 13: January 25. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Although I hit a brick wall yesterday, I have pushed through and light has dawned on the areas I was having trouble getting my head around. I ended up getting my Portfolio Project 99.9% completed. I just need to tweak here or there for cosmetic/perfectionist ways. Uploaded a copy of the Portfolio Project code to GitHub.

**Thoughts**: Remember to push and read and try...so the next day or so the answer is visible.

Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/956702447195566080

### Day 14: January 26. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Tweaked my Portfolio Project a little bit. Started the 'Basic JavaScript' portion of the 'Front End Development Certification' course and got through about 25 units. 

**Thoughts**: Python and JavaScript were the top two most sought skills going into 2018. I bet CSS Grid is up there too as it becomes more adopted across all browsers and devices. Looking forward to starting my Coursera course on Python!

**Link to work**: Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/957084911751630849

### Day 15: January 27. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Upgrading my WordPress sites to PHP v7...which is a pain because of the mySQL to mySQLi injection. I may choose to forward two of the URL's as they are no longer needed/active. Pick my battles on which to update/upgrade. Thinking of buying davidqpyle.io as my 'tech' portfolio page. Continued 'Basic JavaScript' portion of the 'Front End Development Certification' course and got through another 15 units.

**Thought**: Loving all the support and reading articles/blogs from other 100DaysOfCode challengers. Really does give you hope that all this learing from various parts of the internet will add up to something bigger one day lol

**Link to work**: Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/957418931236622336

### Day 16: January 28. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished upgrading my WordPress sites to a supported PHP version...pulled the trigger and now any and all sites are officially on v7. Not much else besides reading and absorbing. 

**Thought**: 

**Link to work**: Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/957808597894881280

### Day 17: January 29. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Continued 'Basic JavaScript' portion of the 'Front End Development Certification' course and got through 8 units... Arrays Functions Parameters Arguments were confusing at first (well, arrays, sub-arrays and multi-dimensional arrays).

**Thoughts**: Even though you may not want to sit down and code, you'll find that you are quickly absorbed into what you are learning or accomplishing that you forget you never wanted to sit down in the first place.

**Link to work**: Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/958165445152051200

### Day 18: January 30. Tuesday

**Today's Prgress**: IF you can call it progress, I went through another 3 units today covering Global and Local Scopes. Doesn't make much sense...or at least how the lesson was drawn up and laid out in the code screen. Registered a couple of domains davidqpyle .net and .me. I updated the .me site with my Portfolio Project, overhauled the footer icons in GIMP, and re-wrote my About Me section. Added my Musical Portfolio page to the 'Portfolio' section.

**Thoughts**: I have to get my head around these Scopes.

**Link to work**: Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/958529528753807360

### Day 19: January 31. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Only finished 2 units today as I need to back up and take another look at JavaScript fundamentals.

**Thoughts**: 

**Link to work**: Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/958917067989712897

### Day 20: February 1. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Spent 2.5 hours watching multiple YouTube tutorials on JavaScript. I still want to spend another day or two going over additional tutorials before going back to the freeCodeCamp Development course. I want to fully understand.

**Thoughts**: Sometimes you cannot just start running because you decided to run. Sometimes, you have to warm up and sometimes you may have a bum ankle. But put in the work and time and soon enough you'll be running far ahead.

**Link to work**: YouTube vids I watched:

Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/959267634532573184

### Day 21: February 2. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Watched entire playlist of JavaScript Tutorials from @bucky_roberts on YouTube. Best parts were episodes 25 through 30 on Objects and the "this" item. 40 videos in all. Some outdted information was included such as 'new Array' instead of just omitting the 'new' altogether. There were a few others that I cannot recall atm.

**Thoughts**: Getting a little better grasp on JavaScript

Twitter link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/959615465839620102

### Day 22: February 3. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started off the day with JavaScript documentation and W3School. Learning more and more about Arrays Methods Objects Elements and installed Atom Editor on my notebook.

**Thoughts**: Chip away, chip away.

**Link to work**: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp
Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/959938689592971265

### Day 23: February 4. SuperBowl Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Not much. Spent most of the time today still going over MDN and W3School documentation and examples.

**Thoughts**: I don't want to see the Patriots or the Eagles win a SuperBowl today!

**Link to work**: Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/960273302458683392

### OFF Day: February 5. Monday

**Thoughts**: Missed today's #100DaysOfCode due to being under the weather (SuperBowl), but like the rules state, I got right back on it! 

**Link**: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/961030709820514305

### Day 24: February 6. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Got through another 23 units on the 'Front End Development' Certification course. The hours of tutorials I watched and read over the last week on Javascript seemed to have really paid off! Updated GitHub daily log since the last entry was Feb 1.

**Thoughts**: I was overthinking the 'Stand In Line' challenge and essentially had the correct answer dozens of times over and over, but the wording of the challenge appears to be incorrect as well. The forum had many people saying the same thing about this challenge.

**Link to work**: Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/961030710969753602

### Day 25: February 7. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Got through another couple units on the 'Front End Dev' Certification course. Worked more on my portfolio site and that led me digging deeper into background images opacity and rgba CSS documentation and examples. Applied new background to site.

**Thoughts**: I should go back and review HTML and go further into CSS Grid

**Link to work**: Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/961461934666276864

### Day 26: February 8. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Studied more JavaScript, mainly about passing data to functions and also increments and decrements. Trying to learn enough to work out Card Counting challenge on the Front End Dev course. Played around with the CSS on my portfolio site and learned more about ‘radius’. Changed all my body divs to radius (rounded edges)

**Thoughts**: Need more training on JavaScript. I actually need training and a project to build so I can see real world examples on how it works in life.

**Link to work**: http://www.davidqpyle.me/ Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/961811965487104000

### Day 27: February 9. Friday

**Today's Progress**: I started a @udemy JavaScript Essential Mini-Course 2018 and watched a handful of videos. Pretty good free primer on the essentials I have learned so far. 

**Thoughts**: Every tutor or video teaches in such dramatically different ways. Maybe that is what I need to strive for....finding that one instructor that teaches me with a connection. That is a new goal, to find tht instructor!

### Day 28: February 10. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished the udemy JavaScript Essentials 2018 mini-course. Updated daily log for the past few days. Found another course to tak, but this time with a hands on project.

**Thoughts**: Sometimes I feel like I cannot learn all the things I am going to need to know to become a fully functional developer. Just so much information and knowledge to gain...and remember!
