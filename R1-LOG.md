### Day 3: January 15. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started the 'Responsive Design with Bootstrap' in the Front End Development Certification course! Over halfway through that...tomorrow finish the segment starting at 'Create a Bootstrap Headline'

**Thoughts**: Worked with Bootstrap in later Wordpress templates and it kind of intimidated me back then. Now, not so much as I am learning the ins and outs of it. I did work with FontAwesome on previous sites, but the syntax in the courses have expanded that use for sure.

### Day 7: January 19. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed my 'Tribute Page' project on the 'Front End Development Certification' course. My tribute was to the late great Lemmy Kilmister 

**Thoughts**: Noticed some bootstrap elements are not 'all-browser' compliant...ugg. Looks differently in Firefox than Chrome, for example.
