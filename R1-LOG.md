## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - 2018

### Day 30: February 12. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started the CSS Grid course by Wes Bos. Checked out some podcasts on the freeCodeCamp site. Some were okay, different views on coding and learning.

**Thoughts**: I really enjoy hopping back and forth between different subjects - i.e. HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Hopefully it won't lead to confusion the deeper I get, but so far so good. They seem to work well together and also just stripped down on their own.

### Day 29: February 11. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the JavaScript Essentials 2018 Mini Course on Udemy and signed up for two other free courses. One being a Full Stack Web Developer Course and the other a free Ultimate HTML Developer Course. Got through another few challenges on the freeCodeCamp Front End Development Certification course.

**Thoughts**: I realized I have been writing this daily log backwards. I should be updating at the top. I'll re-arrange one of these days but today was the day to start, lol.

### Day 2: January 14. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished 'HTML5 and CSS' #refresher in the Front End Development Certification course!

**Thoughts**: CCS and HTML have not changed much since the last time I was programming a few years back. Coming back to me...

### Day 3: January 15. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started the 'Responsive Design with Bootstrap' in the Front End Development Certification course! Over halfway through that...tomorrow finish the segment starting at 'Create a Bootstrap Headline'

**Thoughts**: Worked with Bootstrap in later Wordpress templates and it kind of intimidated me back then. Now, not so much as I am learning the ins and outs of it. I did work with FontAwesome on previous sites, but the syntax in the courses have expanded that use for sure.

### Day 4: January 16. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 'Responsive Design with Bootstrap' in the Front End Development Certification course! Started the jQuery course

**Thoughts**: Stay the course

### Day 5: January 17. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Set up GitHub, watched tutorials and read articles related to the use of GitHub. Installed on my Linux and working with CLI to clone reps, update files, get status, add files, learn to comment my commits ( -m ) 
Set up my daily log for my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Completed the 'jQuery' in the Front End Development Certification course!

**Thoughts**: Gotta crawl before you walk

**Link to work**: I used the following to learn more about GitHub:

### Day 6: January 18. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started the 'Tribute Page' project on the 'Front End Development Certification' course. Committed to only using Bootstrap. I am using getbootstrap.com resources like crazy just learning all the rules and syntax.

**Thoughts**: I need to see what other sites are available for Bootstrap tips and tricks. Currently learning version 4.

### Day 7: January 19. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed my 'Tribute Page' project on the 'Front End Development Certification' course. My tribute was to the late great Lemmy Kilmister 

**Thoughts**: Noticed some bootstrap elements are not 'all-browser' compliant...ugg. Looks differently in Firefox than Chrome, for example.

Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/954447265808216065

### Day 8: January 20. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Uploaded my Tribute Page code/file to GitHub repo. Reviewed the next project requirements for the Portfolio' project and started with initial design layout ideas. Started reading 'Practical Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python 3.6' as I want to sign up for the Coursera UofT's 'Learn to Program: The Fundamentals' course.

**Thoughts**: Don't take on too much too soon and get burnt out! Don't a breath and approach each day as its own, not worrying about what you still need to accomplish!

### Day 9: January 21. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished 1st part of 'Learn CSS Grid' on Scrimba as I want to incorporate this into my portfolio project instead of bootstrap. It's compliant across all browsers and appears to be less code and fuss.

**Thoughts**: So many ways you can use new libraries and techniques to create layouts for front end development!

### Day 10: January 22. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Not much today. I learned more about using CSS Grid fixed positions so I can incorporate it into my portfilio project. I need the navigation to stay fixed on the screen while scrolling. This means this 'container' needs to be in it's own grid or else you'll break the rest of the grid where content and footer would be. I also updated the Wordpress version on company site and registered additional domains.

**Thoughts**: Goal is to have Portfolio Project completed by end of week, using as much CSS Grid as possible.

### Day 11: January 23. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Studied, read, practiced more CSS Grid articles, documentation, examples and blogs. Started practicing on the Portfolio Project. Installed 'Brackets' IDE.

**Thoughts**: I'd really like to maybe specialize or focus on CSS Design and Coding

### Day 12: January 24. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Didn't feel like much progress was made. In fact, I felt like an idiot throughout the day trying to code my Portfolio Project. I have been trying to use CSS Grid and HTML, no other libraries or tools. I just hit a brick wall. I ended up reading about 4 hours of documentation related to CSS, HTML, Grid, Flex, you name it!

**Thoughts**: There is SOOOOOOO much to learn and apply yet.

**Link to work**: Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/956366303849340929

### Day 13: January 25. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Although I hit a brick wall yesterday, I have pushed through and light has dawned on the areas I was having trouble getting my head around. I ended up getting my Portfolio Project 99.9% completed. I just need to tweak here or there for cosmetic/perfectionist ways. Uploaded a copy of the Portfolio Project code to GitHub.

**Thoughts**: Remember to push and read and try...so the next day or so the answer is visible.

### Day 14: January 26. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Tweaked my Portfolio Project a little bit. Started the 'Basic JavaScript' portion of the 'Front End Development Certification' course and got through about 25 units. 

**Thoughts**: Python and JavaScript were the top two most sought skills going into 2018. I bet CSS Grid is up there too as it becomes more adopted across all browsers and devices. Looking forward to starting my Coursera course on Python!

### Day 15: January 27. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Upgrading my WordPress sites to PHP v7...which is a pain because of the mySQL to mySQLi injection. I may choose to forward two of the URL's as they are no longer needed/active. Pick my battles on which to update/upgrade. Thinking of buying davidqpyle.io as my 'tech' portfolio page. Continued 'Basic JavaScript' portion of the 'Front End Development Certification' course and got through another 15 units.

**Thought**: Loving all the support and reading articles/blogs from other 100DaysOfCode challengers. Really does give you hope that all this learing from various parts of the internet will add up to something bigger one day lol

**Link to work**: Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/957418931236622336

### Day 16: January 28. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished upgrading my WordPress sites to a supported PHP version...pulled the trigger and now any and all sites are officially on v7. Not much else besides reading and absorbing. 

**Thought**:

### Day 17: January 29. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Continued 'Basic JavaScript' portion of the 'Front End Development Certification' course and got through 8 units... Arrays Functions Parameters Arguments were confusing at first (well, arrays, sub-arrays and multi-dimensional arrays).

**Thoughts**: Even though you may not want to sit down and code, you'll find that you are quickly absorbed into what you are learning or accomplishing that you forget you never wanted to sit down in the first place.

### Day 18: January 30. Tuesday

**Today's Prgress**: IF you can call it progress, I went through another 3 units today covering Global and Local Scopes. Doesn't make much sense...or at least how the lesson was drawn up and laid out in the code screen. Registered a couple of domains davidqpyle .net and .me. I updated the .me site with my Portfolio Project, overhauled the footer icons in GIMP, and re-wrote my About Me section. Added my Musical Portfolio page to the 'Portfolio' section.

**Thoughts**: I have to get my head around these Scopes.

**Link to work**: Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/958529528753807360

### Day 19: January 31. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Only finished 2 units today as I need to back up and take another look at JavaScript fundamentals.

**Thoughts**:

### Day 20: February 1. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Spent 2.5 hours watching multiple YouTube tutorials on JavaScript. I still want to spend another day or two going over additional tutorials before going back to the freeCodeCamp Development course. I want to fully understand.

**Thoughts**: Sometimes you cannot just start running because you decided to run. Sometimes, you have to warm up and sometimes you may have a bum ankle. But put in the work and time and soon enough you'll be running far ahead.

**Link to work**: YouTube vids I watched:

### Day 21: February 2. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Watched entire playlist of JavaScript Tutorials from @bucky_roberts on YouTube. Best parts were episodes 25 through 30 on Objects and the "this" item. 40 videos in all. Some outdted information was included such as 'new Array' instead of just omitting the 'new' altogether. There were a few others that I cannot recall atm.

**Thoughts**: Getting a little better grasp on JavaScript

### Day 22: February 3. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started off the day with JavaScript documentation and W3School. Learning more and more about Arrays Methods Objects Elements and installed Atom Editor on my notebook.

**Thoughts**: Chip away, chip away.

### Day 23: February 4. SuperBowl Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Not much. Spent most of the time today still going over MDN and W3School documentation and examples.

**Thoughts**: I don't want to see the Patriots or the Eagles win a SuperBowl today!

**Link to work**: Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/960273302458683392

### OFF Day: February 5. Monday

**Thoughts**: Missed today's #100DaysOfCode due to being under the weather (SuperBowl), but like the rules state, I got right back on it! 

**Link**: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/961030709820514305

### Day 24: February 6. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Got through another 23 units on the 'Front End Development' Certification course. The hours of tutorials I watched and read over the last week on Javascript seemed to have really paid off! Updated GitHub daily log since the last entry was Feb 1.

**Thoughts**: I was overthinking the 'Stand In Line' challenge and essentially had the correct answer dozens of times over and over, but the wording of the challenge appears to be incorrect as well. The forum had many people saying the same thing about this challenge.

**Link to work**: Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/961030710969753602

### Day 25: February 7. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Got through another couple units on the 'Front End Dev' Certification course. Worked more on my portfolio site and that led me digging deeper into background images opacity and rgba CSS documentation and examples. Applied new background to site.

**Thoughts**: I should go back and review HTML and go further into CSS Grid

**Link to work**: Tweet link: https://twitter.com/davidqpyle/status/961461934666276864

### Day 26: February 8. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Studied more JavaScript, mainly about passing data to functions and also increments and decrements. Trying to learn enough to work out Card Counting challenge on the Front End Dev course. Played around with the CSS on my portfolio site and learned more about ‘radius’. Changed all my body divs to radius (rounded edges)

**Thoughts**: Need more training on JavaScript. I actually need training and a project to build so I can see real world examples on how it works in life.

### Day 27: February 9. Friday

**Today's Progress**: I started a @udemy JavaScript Essential Mini-Course 2018 and watched a handful of videos. Pretty good free primer on the essentials I have learned so far. 

**Thoughts**: Every tutor or video teaches in such dramatically different ways. Maybe that is what I need to strive for....finding that one instructor that teaches me with a connection. That is a new goal, to find tht instructor!

### Day 28: February 10. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished the udemy JavaScript Essentials 2018 mini-course. Updated daily log for the past few days. Found another course to tak, but this time with a hands on project.

**Thoughts**: Sometimes I feel like I cannot learn all the things I am going to need to know to become a fully functional developer. Just so much information and knowledge to gain...and remember!
