### Day 2: January 14. Sunday

### Day 3: January 15. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started the 'Responsive Design with Bootstrap' in the Front End Development Certification course! Over halfway through that...tomorrow finish the segment starting at 'Create a Bootstrap Headline'

**Thoughts**: Worked with Bootstrap in later Wordpress templates and it kind of intimidated me back then. Now, not so much as I am learning the ins and outs of it. I did work with FontAwesome on previous sites, but the syntax in the courses have expanded that use for sure.

**Today's Progress**: Set up GitHub, watched tutorials and read articles related to the use of GitHub. Installed on my Linux and working with CLI to clone reps, update files, get status, add files, learn to comment my commits ( -m ) 
Set up my daily log for my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Completed the 'jQuery' in the Front End Development Certification course!

### Day 6: January 18. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started the 'Tribute Page' project on the 'Front End Development Certification' course. Committed to only using Bootstrap. I am using getbootstrap.com resources like crazy just learning all the rules and syntax.

**Thoughts**: I need to see what other sites are available for Bootstrap tips and tricks. Currently learning version 4.

### Day 7: January 19. Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed my 'Tribute Page' project on the 'Front End Development Certification' course. My tribute was to the late great Lemmy Kilmister 

**Thoughts**: Noticed some bootstrap elements are not 'all-browser' compliant...ugg. Looks differently in Firefox than Chrome, for example.

### Day 8: January 20. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Uploaded my Tribute Page code/file to GitHub repo. Reviewed the next project requirements for the Portfolio' project and started with initial design layout ideas. Started reading 'Practical Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python 3.6' as I want to sign up for the Coursera UofT's 'Learn to Program: The Fundamentals' course.

**Thoughts**: Don't take on too much too soon and get burnt out! Don't a breath and approach each day as its own, not worrying about what you still need to accomplish!

### Day 9: January 21. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished 1st part of 'Learn CSS Grid' on Scrimba as I want to incorporate this into my portfolio project instead of bootstrap. It's compliant across all browsers and appears to be less code and fuss.

**Thoughts**: So many ways you can use new libraries and techniques to create layouts for front end development!

### Day 10: January 22. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Not much today. I learned more about using CSS Grid fixed positions so I can incorporate it into my portfilio project. I need the navigation to stay fixed on the screen while scrolling. This means this 'container' needs to be in it's own grid or else you'll break the rest of the grid where content and footer would be. I also updated the Wordpress version on company site and registered additional domains.

**Thoughts**: Goal is to have Portfolio Project completed by end of week, using as much CSS Grid as possible.

### Day 11: January 23. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Studied, read, practiced more CSS Grid articles, documentation, examples and blogs. Started practicing on the Portfolio Project. Installed 'Brackets' IDE.

**Thoughts**: I'd really like to maybe specialize or focus on CSS Design and Coding

### Day 12: January 24. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Didn't feel like much progress was made. In fact, I felt like an idiot throughout the day trying to code my Portfolio Project. I have been trying to use CSS Grid and HTML, no other libraries or tools. I just hit a brick wall. I ended up reading about 4 hours of documentation related to CSS, HTML, Grid, Flex, you name it!

**Thoughts**: There is SOOOOOOO much to learn and apply yet.

### Day 13: January 25. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Although I hit a brick wall yesterday, I have pushed through and light has dawned on the areas I was having trouble getting my head around. I ended up getting my Portfolio Project 99.9% completed. I just need to tweak here or there for cosmetic/perfectionist ways. Uploaded a copy of the Portfolio Project code to GitHub.

**Thoughts**: Remember to push and read and try...so the next day or so the answer is visible.
